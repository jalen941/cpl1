Initial problem statement: Create a scanner for a subset of the SCL language
Summary and purpose of the report/assignment: The purpose of the scanner is to scan through the SCL file and tokenize each appropriate character.
Detailed description of the solution used in the assignment or project: I used Javaâ€™s org.json library to create an array list of JSONObjects, each object contains the token type and the token that was scanned. It checks each character scanned and tokenizes it via my create token method.
Table or list of input data and results: Here is an example, I tested a simple SCL file that i created: 
FUNCTION MAIN is
variables
    define y of type int
    define z of type int
    define total of type int

BEGIN
    SET y = 10;
    SET z = 5;
SET p = 20;
SET total = y + z;
    if total > p
	DISPLAY true
     else
	DISPLAY false
	endif
END MAIN

Overall, this scanner will properly tokenize a subset of the SCL laguage and provide the proper format that the parser can parse to check the syntax.
